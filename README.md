# Channel-Selection-Strategy
Channel Selection Strategy for Hyperspectral object tracking

The channel selection strategy is composed of contrast module (contrast. p), entropy module (entropy. p) and target background difference module (try_TBD. p). 
The final selection strategy (H2TC. p) completes the channel selection.

Run the demo code to complete the channel selection.

The data set used by the code is from: https://www.hsitracking.com/
